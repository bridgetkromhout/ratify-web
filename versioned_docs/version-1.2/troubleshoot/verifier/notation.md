# Troubleshoot Notation Verifier Errors

If an image verification failed for some reason, please check the logs in Ratify pod to inspect the related error logs.

Below is an example of a result log that occurs when Notation verifier fails to verify an image.

```json
"verifierReports": [
    {
      "subject": "ghcr.io/deislabs/ratify/notary-image@sha256:8e3d01113285a0e4aa574da8eb9c0f112a1eb979d72f73399d7175ba3cdb1c1b",
      "referenceDigest": "sha256:57be2c1c3d9c23ef7c964bba05c7aa23b525732e9c9af9652654ccc3f4babb0e",
      "artifactType": "application/vnd.cncf.notary.signature",
      "verifierReports": [
        {
          "isSuccess": false,
          "message": "Original Error: (Original Error: (artifact \"ghcr.io/deislabs/ratify/notary-image@sha256:8e3d01113285a0e4aa574da8eb9c0f112a1eb979d72f73399d7175ba3cdb1c1b\" has no applicable trust policy. Trust policy applicability for a given artifact is determined by registryScopes. To create a trust policy, see: https://notaryproject.dev/docs/quickstart/#create-a-trust-policy), Error: verify signature failure, Code: VERIFY_PLUGIN_FAILURE, Plugin Name: notation, Component Type: verifier, Documentation: https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/tree/main/specs, Detail: failed to verify signature of digest), Error: verify reference failure, Code: VERIFY_PLUGIN_FAILURE, Plugin Name: notation, Component Type: verifier",
          "name": "notation",
          "extensions": null
        }
      ],
      "nestedReports": []
    }
  ]
```

Users can investigate the root cause of the Notation verifier by checking the `message` field of each failed `verifierReport`. The error message could be a nested error. The Notation error is the most inner error, e.g. `artifact \"ghcr.io/deislabs/ratify/notary-image@sha256:8e3d01113285a0e4aa574da8eb9c0f112a1eb979d72f73399d7175ba3cdb1c1b\" has no applicable trust policy. Trust policy applicability for a given artifact is determined by registryScopes. To create a trust policy, see: https://notaryproject.dev/docs/quickstart/#create-a-trust-policy` in the above example.

Since the other levels of the error are always the same, this TSG focuses on different errors returned by Notation verifier.

## Debugging Commands
To inspect the Notation verifier configuration, please use ```kubectl describe``` or ```kubectl get``` command to retrieve it.
```bash
kubectl describe verifiers.config.ratify.deislabs.io
```
or

```bash
kubectl get verifiers.config.ratify.deislabs.io -o yaml
```

## Scenario 1
```
artifact URI [uri] could not be parsed, make sure it is the fully qualified OCI artifact URI without the scheme/protocol. e.g domain.com:80/my/repository@sha256:digest
```

### Cause and Solution
The provided reference URI doesn't contain character `@` which is required by Notation verifier. Please check the reference URI and make sure it is in the correct format. 

Check [documentation](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/main/specs/trust-store-trust-policy.md#selecting-a-trust-policy-based-on-artifact-uri) for more details.

## Scenario 2
```
registry scope [scope] is not valid, make sure it is a fully qualified repository without the scheme, protocol or tag. For example domain.com/my/repository or a local scope like local/myOCILayout
```
Or
```
registry scope [scope] with wild card(s) is not valid, make sure it is a fully qualified repository without the scheme, protocol or tag. For example domain.com/my/repository or a local scope like local/myOCILayout
```

### Cause and Solution
Please inspect the `registryScope` in `TrustPolicy` of Notation Verifier CR and make sure it is correct by using the [debugging commands](#debugging-commands).

Check [documentation](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/main/specs/trust-store-trust-policy.md#selecting-a-trust-policy-based-on-artifact-uri) for more details.

## Scenario 3
```
artifact [uri] has no applicable trust policy. Trust policy applicability for a given artifact is determined by registryScopes. To create a trust policy, see: https://notaryproject.dev/docs/quickstart/#create-a-trust-policy
```

### Cause and Solution
Notation verifier cannot find a trust policy matching the given artifact reference. Please check if the registryScope of trust policy is correctly set up. Run the [debugging commands](#debugging-commands) to get the Notation veifier configuration.

Check [documentation](https://notaryproject.dev/docs/quickstart/#create-a-trust-policy) for more details.

## Scenario 4
```
signature is not produced by a trusted signer
```

### Cause and Solution
The signatureâ€™s SignerInfo does not match any certificate in the trust store. Please ensure that the correct certificate is configured in the trust store to verify the signature. Additionally, double-check that the trust policy specifies the correct trust store.

Check [documentation](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/main/specs/trust-store-trust-policy.md#steps) to see how to verify the authenticity.

## Scenario 5
```
digital signature has expired on [timestamp]
```

### Cause and Solution
The signature has expired. Please re-sign the image.

## Scenario 6
```
signing certificate with subject [subject] is revoked
```

### Cause and Solution
The certificate used to sign the image has been revoked. Please re-sign the image with a valid certificate.

## Scenario 7
```
error while parsing the certificate subject from the digital signature. error : [error message]
```

### Cause and Solution
This error usually occurs when the certificate subject of a certificate from the signature is invalid. Please check the error message for specific error. The subject MUST follow [RFC 4514 DN](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4514) syntax.

## Scenario 8
```
error while loading the trust store, [error message]
```

### Cause and Solution
This error usually occurs when the trust store is not configured correctly. Please check the error message for specific error.

Check [Trust Policy](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/main/specs/trust-store-trust-policy.md#trust-policy) and [Trust Store](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/main/specs/trust-store-trust-policy.md#trust-store) specs for more details.
