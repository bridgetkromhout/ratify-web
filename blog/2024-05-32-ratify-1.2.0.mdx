We are thrilled to announce the release of Ratify v1.2.0! 

Ratify is a comprehensive verification framework designed to ensure that all supply chain artifacts stored in a registry are thoroughly vetted and trustworthy. By integrating Ratify into your workflow, you can safeguard your deployment pipeline from potential threats and vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall security of your operations. To see an end to end example of how Ratify can be used, check out this Microsoft Build 2024 session: [Securing the Containersâ€™ Supply Chain for Azure Kubernetes Service](https://youtu.be/5W-22xU4EP0?si=EMlmTDXRzFHj0zw0). 

Read on to discover the exciting new features and how they can benefit you!

## Cosign Verifier Enhancements

We have made significant enhancements to the Cosign Verifier to improve both security and usability. 

One notable change is that Cosign is now a built-in verifier, making it easier to integrate and use within Ratify. We have also added key support to the key management provider, allowing for more flexible and secure key management. 

Additionally, we have introduced Cosign trust policies, which enhance the ability to manage and enforce security policies. These improvements enhance the reliability and effectiveness of the Cosign Verifier, making it a powerful tool for your security needs.

## Kubernetes Multi-Tenancy Support

Ratify now includes multi-tenancy support. This new feature is designed to improve resource efficiency within Kubernetes clusters by enabling both multi-team and multi-customer architectures. 

Multi-tenancy primarily focuses on a multi-team model, allowing organizations to effectively manage namespaces and allocate resources. Key user roles, such as cluster admins, team admins, and team developers, now have defined access and management capabilities.

The addition of multi-tenancy support aims to facilitate seamless deployment, robust security, and efficient resource utilization, ensuring a smoother and more scalable experience for all.

## CRD Improvements

Ratify v1.2.0 introduces several improvements to Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to enhance their functionality and robustness. Here are the key enhancements:

1. Version Control: We have added a version field to the CRD spec, allowing for better version control and management of custom resources.

2. Plugin Name Validation: On Custom Resource creation, we now validate the plugin name to ensure consistency and correctness, reducing potential errors and conflicts.

3. Key Management Provider Resource: We have introduced a key management provider resource, which facilitates more secure and efficient key management.

4. NamespacedKMP and Cluster Level Scope: We have added NamespacedKMP and switched the Key Management Provider scope to the cluster level. This significantly improves multi-tenancy support and resource isolation within Kubernetes.

These enhancements make CRDs more versatile and reliable for diverse deployment scenarios.
