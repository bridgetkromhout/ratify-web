We are thrilled to announce the release of [Ratify v1.4.0](https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/releases/tag/v1.4.0)! This milestone release introduces significant new features that enhance Ratify's capabilities as a trusted supply chain security tool. As always, we deeply appreciate the contributions from the community, which make these advancements possible.

## New Features

### Revocation Checking with Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Support
   
Security in supply chain verification is critical, and this release marks an important step forward with the addition of revocation checking. Ratify supports validating signing identity (certificate and certificate chain) revocation status using certificate revocation evaluation as per revocation setting in Notation trust policy. The CRL implementation uses Notation libraries and follows the [Notary Project specification](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/v1.1.0/specs/trust-store-trust-policy.md#crls). This ensures that revoked certificates are promptly identified and excluded from the trust chain, providing an extra layer of security for artifact verification workflows.
See [Certificate Revocation Check (CRL) guidance](https://ratify.dev/docs/plugins/verifier/notation#certificate-revocation-check-crl) for details.

### Enhanced Notation Trust Policy Attributes in Helm Chart

To provide an out-of-the-box experience for users, this release adds more notation trust policy attributes to the `values.yaml` of the Ratify Helm Chart. This enhancement addresses three major scenarios outlined in [this issue](https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/issues/1965), simplifying configuration and streamlining deployment processes for common use cases:

- Organizational Signing Policies: Ratify now allows users to easily define and enforce organization-wide signing policies directly from the Helm Chart. This ensures that artifacts meet predefined security requirements before being trusted.

- Customizable Configurations: Different environments, such as development, staging, and production, often require unique trust policies. With the updated Helm Chart, users can seamlessly customize configurations for each environment without manual adjustments.

- Multi-Tenancy: For organizations managing multiple tenants, the new attributes enable granular control over trust policies for each tenant, ensuring alignment with their specific security needs.

### Alibaba Cloud RRSA Store Authentication Provider

Ratify continues to expand its support for cloud-native ecosystems with the introduction of a new authentication provider for the Alibaba Cloud RRSA Store. Users leveraging Alibaba Cloud’s RRSA can now seamlessly integrate with Ratify, enabling secure artifact signing and verification within their workflows. This feature reflects our commitment to supporting a diverse and growing range of platforms in the cloud-native landscape. As a new partner of Ratify, Alibaba Cloud also created a [guidance](https://ratify.dev/docs/quickstarts/ratify-on-alibabacloud) on how to use Ratify on Alibaba Cloud using Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) and Alibaba Cloud Container Registry (ACR).

## Other enhancements

### Image signing

Ratify official images are now signed by Notation and Cosign to ensure their integrity and authenticity. This helps defend against supply chain attacks by preventing tampered or untrusted images from being deployed in production environments. For more information, see the [Signature Validation document](https://ratify.dev/docs/troubleshoot/security/#signature-validation).

### Enhanced diagnose experience

This release also adds `timestamp` and `traceID` in verification response to help users identity the failing request easily. The default constraint template is updated to report the `timestamp` and `traceID` when validation fails.
