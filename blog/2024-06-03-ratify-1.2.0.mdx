We are thrilled to announce the release of Ratify v1.2.0! 

Ratify is a comprehensive verification framework designed to ensure that all supply chain artifacts stored in a registry are thoroughly vetted and trustworthy. By integrating Ratify into your workflow, you can safeguard your deployment pipeline from potential threats and vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall security of your operations. To see an end to end example of how Ratify can be used, check out this Microsoft Build 2024 session: [Securing the Containersâ€™ Supply Chain for Azure Kubernetes Service](https://youtu.be/5W-22xU4EP0?si=EMlmTDXRzFHj0zw0). 

Read on to discover the exciting new features and how they can benefit you!

Deprecations:
- `CertificateStore` is deprecated in favor of `KeyManagementProvider` (KMP). Please migrate to `KeyManagementProvider` by following guide [here](https://ratify.dev/docs/reference/custom%20resources/key-management-providers#migrating-from-certificatestore-to-kmp). Support will be removed in Ratify v2.0.0

## A brand new Cosign experience! 

Starting in v1.2.0, Ratify now has more comprehensive Cosign verification capabilities. 

Verification of Cosign signatures is a critical validation. As such, the Cosign verifier is now a built-in verifier along with the Notation verifier. Beyond first class support, the Cosign verifier introduces a `Trust Policy` which binds a particular set of verification settings to a certain registry scope. Now, it's possible to specify multiple trust policies based on your registry, namespace, and/or image. 

Cosign verification also includes a robust key experience that integrates directly with KMP resources. Expanded capabilities include: multiple key support from KMP or filesystem and RSA + elliptical keys across multiple sizes.

## Support for Multi-Tenancy in Kubernetes

Ratify now includes multi-tenancy support. This new feature is designed to improve resource efficiency within Kubernetes clusters by enabling both multi-team and multi-customer architectures. 

Multi-tenancy primarily focuses on a multi-team model, allowing organizations to effectively manage namespaces and allocate resources. Key user roles, such as cluster admins, team admins, and team developers, now have defined access and management capabilities.

The addition of multi-tenancy support aims to facilitate seamless deployment, robust security, and efficient resource utilization, ensuring a smoother and more scalable experience for all.

## Introduction of the Key Management Provider

In this release, we are introducing the KeyManagementProvider (KMP), a new resource designed to replace the existing CertificateStore. 

The KMP resource is a comprehensive solution for managing and retrieving keys and certificates. It includes an inline provider, which allows for the specification of a single key or certificate. Additionally, it features an Azure Key Vault provider, which enables the fetching of any number of keys or certificates. 

This new feature aims to streamline key and certificate management, enhancing the efficiency and security of your operations.

## An invitation to contribute!

We are thrilled to share that Ratify is currently [under review](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/96) to be adopted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). 

This marks an exciting opportunity for Ratify to become an open and inclusive project, welcoming contributions from the entire community. We encourage you to get involved, whether you're a developer, tester, or user. Your input and contributions are invaluable to us.
