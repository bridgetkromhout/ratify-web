We are excited to announce the release of Ratify v1.3.0!

Ratify is now a CNCF sandbox project! We sincerely thank the exceptional community for invaluable contributions and unwavering support in reaching this significant milestone.
Ratify is a verification framework that ensures container images and supply chain artifacts stored in a registry are thoroughly vetted and trustworthy. 
By [integrating Ratify into your Kubernetes](https://notaryproject.dev/blog/2023/announcing-major-release/#integration-with-admission-controller-for-kubernetes-usage) workflow, 
you can safeguard your application deployment against potential threats and vulnerabilities, thereby greatly enhancing the security of your applications.

## Features and Deprecations

Key features in this release include:
- Support of validating Notary Project signatures with timestamping
- Support of periodic retrieval of keys and certificates stored in a KMS (Key Management System)
- Introducing new keyless verification configuration for verifying Cosign signatures
- Improving error messages for artifact verification

### Support of validating Notary Project signatures with timestamping

Ratify now supports verifying Notary Project signatures with timestamping. 
Since [Notation v1.2.0 release](https://notaryproject.dev/blog/2024/announcing-notation-v1-2/), Notary Project supports [RFC 3161](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3161)-compliant timestamping. 
This enhancement extends the trust of signatures created within the certificate's validity period by trusting on a Timestamping Authority (TSA), 
enabling successful signature verification even after the certificates have expired. 
Timestamping reduces costs by eliminating the need to periodically re-sign images due to certificate expiry, which is critical when using short-lived certificates. 
To validate Notary Project signatures that include timestamps from a TSA, it's essential for a verifier to determine trusted entities both as the image signer and as the TSA. In Ratify, configure trust stores and trust policies in the Notation verifier to establish this trust. For more information, see the [configuration of Notation verifier] (https://ratify.dev/docs/next/plugins/verifier/notation/#configuration).

### Support of periodic retrieval of keys and certificates stored in a KMS

Users configure keys and certificates through Key Management Providers (KMP) resources for signature verification. Without specifying versions in KMP resources, Ratify fetches the latest versions. Keys or certificates may rotate for security reasons, and automatic rotation is a common practice. When rotated, new versions are created, making the current versions outdated. Before Ratify v1.3.0, users had to manually update KMP resources when versions were rotated or disabled. This could result in verification failures for new versions if updates were not performed promptly. From v1.3.0 onwards, the `refreshInterval` parameter is introduced for KMP resources allowing periodic checks for the latest versions and status validation. Future updates will also support keeping a specified number of previous versions to validate older signatures that may still be in use.

Please note that currently, only the KMP of Azure Key Vault has this support. Let us know if you need support for other KMPs. For more information, see the [Azure Key Vault KMP configuration](https://ratify.dev/docs/next/reference/custom%20resources/key-management-providers#azure-key-vault).

### Introducing new keyless verification configuration for verifying Cosign signatures

Trust policies for the Cosign verifier were introduced . Now, keyless verification can be configured with an updated setup process. For more details, visit Cosign verifier keyless configuration.
### Improving error messages for artifact verification

To improve the troubleshooting experience, since Ratify v1.3.0, we started improving error messages. It is an ongoing effort. We will keep improving for several releases.

## Other enhancements

There are other important enhancements on Ratify project. Since Ratify v1.3.0, we generate supply chain metadata for dev assets, setup  scanners for ratify releases, and add open ssf best practices badge, which will  keep improve the quality of Ratify project and make Ratify more secure.

## Acknowledgements
