We are excited to announce the release of Ratify v1.3.0!

Ratify is now a CNCF sandbox project! We sincerely thank the exceptional community for invaluable contributions and unwavering support in reaching this significant milestone.
Ratify is a verification framework that ensures container images and supply chain artifacts stored in a registry are thoroughly vetted and trustworthy. 
By [integrating Ratify into your Kubernetes](https://notaryproject.dev/blog/2023/announcing-major-release/#integration-with-admission-controller-for-kubernetes-usage) workflow, 
you can safeguard your application deployment against potential threats and vulnerabilities, thereby greatly enhancing the security of your applications.

## Features and Deprecations

Key features in this release include:
- Support of verifying Notary Project signatures with timestamping
- Support of periodic retrieval of keys and certificates stored in a KMS (Key Management System)
- Introducing new keyless verification configuration for verifying Cosign signatures
- Improving error messages for artifact verification

### Support of verifying Notary Project signatures with timestamping

Notary Project supports [RFC 3161](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3161) compliant timestamping since [Notation v1.2.0 release](https://notaryproject.dev/blog/2024/announcing-notation-v1-2/)
Timestamping reduces costs by eliminating the need to periodically re-sign images due to certificate expiry, which is especially critical when using short-lived certificates. 
This enhancement extends the trust of signatures created within the certificate's validity period by relying on a Timestamping Authority (TSA), 
enabling successful signature verification even after the certificates have expired. As a verifier, to verify timestamps from a TSA, you must ensure that both image signers and the associated TSAs are trusted. 
Ratify now supports verifying Notary Project signatures with timestamping through configuring trust stores and trust policies in the [Notation verifier](https://ratify.dev/docs/next/plugins/verifier/notation/#configuration).

### Support of periodic retrieval of keys and certificates stored in a KMS

Users manage keys and certificates via Key Management Providers (KMP) for signature verification. Without specifying versions of keys and certificates, Ratify automatically fetches the latest versions. However, keys or certificates may rotate for certain reasons. As a best practice of security, keys and certificates owners usually enable automatic rotation. When keys and certificates are rotated, new versions are created, making the versions used by Ratify outdated. Prior to Ratify v1.3.0, Ratify would not automatically fetch the latest versions, users had to re-apply relevant KMP resources. In some instances, the versions that used by Ratify were also disabled for certain reasons, which Ratify failed to detect automatically. Users were required to make changes to Ratify manually whenever keys or certificates were rotated or disabled. Otherwise, signature verification will fail for signatures generated by new versions or disabled versions. Since Ratify v1.3.0, users now have an option to use `refreshInterval` parameter to enable periodic retrieval of the latest versions of keys and certificates and validate the status of used versions. Future releases plan to not only fetch the latest versions but also allow users to maintain a certain number of previous versions automatically, so that images that signed by previous versions of keys and certificates can still be validated. 

### Introducing new keyless verification configuration for verifying Cosign signatures

Trust policies for the Cosign verifier were introduced . Now, keyless verification can be configured with an updated setup process. For more details, visit Cosign verifier keyless configuration.
### Improving error messages for artifact verification

To improve the troubleshooting experience, since Ratify v1.3.0, we started improving error messages. It is an ongoing effort. We will keep improving for several releases.

## Other enhancements

There are other important enhancements on Ratify project. Since Ratify v1.3.0, we generate supply chain metadata for dev assets, setup  scanners for ratify releases, and add open ssf best practices badge, which will  keep improve the quality of Ratify project and make Ratify more secure.

## Acknowledgements
